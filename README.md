📝 To-Do List App

This is a simple To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, delete, and manage daily tasks directly in the browser. ((Still a work in progress, but it is operational))

💡 Features:
- Add new tasks using the input field and "Add" button
- Delete tasks individually using the delete button
- Responsive design and basic styling

📁 Technologies Used:
- HTML for structuring the page
- CSS for styling the interface
- JavaScript for interactivity (adding, deleting, and managing tasks)

🧠 What I Learned:
- How to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript
- How to use event listeners
- Creating and styling dynamic elements with JavaScript
- Building basic CRUD-like functionality in a front-end app

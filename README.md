📝 To-Do List App

This is a simple To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, delete, and manage daily tasks directly in the browser.

💡 Features:
- Add new tasks using the input field and "Add" button.
- Delete tasks individually using the delete button.
- Responsive design and basic styling.


📁 Technologies Used:
- HTML for structuring the page.
- CSS for styling the interface.
- JavaScript for interactivity (adding, deleting, and managing tasks).


🧠 What I Learned:
- How to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.
- How to use event listeners.
- Creating and styling dynamic elements with JavaScript.
- Building basic CRUD-like functionality in a front-end app.


🚀 Future Improvements:
- Implement automated UI tests using Selenium with JavaScript to improve reliability and ease of testing.
- Containerize the application using Docker to simplify deployment and environment setup.
- over all system polishing a minor bug fixes.
